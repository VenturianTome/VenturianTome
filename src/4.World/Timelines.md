## Big Events

### The [Housekeeper](5.Characters/Housekeeper.md)'s Future \[*5th Anniversary Livestream*]
- The Housekeeper destroys reality as they know it and reality is melted down into 2-dimensional sprites unless the PI.E. Team convinces Ghost to rejoin the them \[2:18:38 / 2:23:07]
- Spooker should remember to shave his head because it'll save his life one day; Ghost says that he didn't cut his hair in time in the future and now it's hard to look at him; he has to do it at the right time, otherwise it turns out worse \[2:20:50 / 2:27:18]
- Future Ghost tells Toast to learn sign language \[2:25:52]
- The Factory of 2337 is where Billy was turned into a robot; the Homekeeper \(he changed his name by that point) has taken over and creates a robot army to start taking over other planets for his empire \[2:30:08]
- Toast's mother is being impersonated by a lizard man from Venus; Toast has to go to the Ambassador of Germany because he knows how to kill the lizard man \[2:38:56]
- An apartment that Spooker was looking to buy \(and possibly share with Colon) gets bombed in 2123 because the current world leader is living in it when the Housekeeper assassinates him \[2:49:05 / 2:49:19]
  - Ghost wonders if it's one of Spooker's descendants that becomes the world leader in 2132; Spooker says he's too single to have descendants \[2:49:37]

### Toast's Tranformations
- Toast commonly gets turned into things \(vampire, werewolf, Sally, etc.) and it's never explained how he gets fixed \[24:13 - *5th Anniversary Livestream*]
  - Jordan says he always imagines someone smart \(but not Ghost) comes to help them fix it *or* each instance is a different timeline and he's stuck that way
