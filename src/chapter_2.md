# Meet The Admin

## Basics
Hello! Glad to know you're interested to know who's running this site.  
- I call myself V, and this is where I store all of the VenturianTale information that I can find.  
- I've been watching VT since 2013 \(*I can't believe it's already been 6 years!*)
- I believe my first video was the early [Weeping Angels Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4VbP82dVo0) *OR* the [Motorcycle Mod](https://youtu.be/gNREBUzmn98), where I was first introduced to the start of the characters
- I started this site \(with the help of my brother) in July of 2019, but I had the idea started for it all the way back in 2017
