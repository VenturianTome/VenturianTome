- Jordan and Jessica got married on October 31st, 2019 \[0:10 - *I Got Married*]
- Jordan knew he wanted to marry Jessica when they were playing Overwatch, Jessica got upset at him over not getting the Kill Cam, Jordan got the last Kill Cam, and she refused to talk to him for the next few rounds while trying to not laugh at Jordan's jokes  
  - TL;DR: "Overwatch leads to marriage" \[1:37]
- When asked about the publication of their relationship, they agree that they liked having the fanbase know because it's fun to have people to share it with \(including dropping hints, like the cryptic Jessie & Buzz pictures on Instagram) \[4:12 - *Q&A With My Wife*]

> "What did I marry into?" \[4:00 - *I Got Married*]
- \[19:28 / 22:06 - *Q&A With My Wife*] Married life for the couple has so far been a struggle because:
  - Jordan snores like a lawnmower; Jessica talks in her sleep and sometimes gets up and moves around in her sleep
  - Jessica gets cold easily; Jordan gets warm easy
  - Jessica can be genuine or passive-aggressive
  - Jordan doesn't know how to hang up a towel; Jessica gets out of the shower to dry off, leaving water everywhere
- Jordan proposed by talking about it to her rather than just popping the question, letting it come to a confident decision \[20:44 - *Q&A With My Wife*]
  - Asking Jessica to get married had a lot of anxiety and emotions with it; Jordan's favourite moment with Jessica was right after the proposal, when they both were in the "let's do it" mindset and getting everything together for the wedding in a day \[23:30]
- Jordan says travelling with a wife has taught him patience that he didn't know he had \[4:00 - *Q&A With My Wife*]
