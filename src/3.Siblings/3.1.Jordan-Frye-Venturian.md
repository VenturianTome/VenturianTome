- Jordan knew he wanted to marry Jessica when they were playing Overwatch, Jessica got upset at him over not getting the Kill Cam, Jordan got the last Kill Cam, and she refused to talk to him for the next few rounds while trying to not laugh at Jordan's jokes  
  - TL;DR: "Overwatch leads to marriage" \[1:37]

> "What did I marry into?" \[4:00 - *I Got Married*]
- \[19:28 / 22:06 - *Q&A With My Wife*] Married life for the couple has so far been a struggle because:
  - Jordan snores like a lawnmower; Jessica talks in her sleep and sometimes gets up and moves around in her sleep
  - Jessica gets cold easily; Jordan gets warm easy
  - Jessica can be genuine or passive-aggressive
