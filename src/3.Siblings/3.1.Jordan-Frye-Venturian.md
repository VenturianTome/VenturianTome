  - Jordan and Jessica got married on October 31st, 2019 \[0:10 - *I Got Married*]
  - Jordan knew he wanted to marry Jessica when they were playing Overwatch, Jessica got upset at him over not getting the Kill Cam, Jordan got the last Kill Cam, and she refused to talk to him for the next few rounds while trying to not laugh at Jordan's jokes  \[1:37 - *I Got Married*]
    - TL;DR: "Overwatch leads to marriage"

  > "Love has compromise" -Jessica \[22:06 - *Q&A With My Wife*]

  > "What did I marry into?" \[4:00 - *I Got Married*]
  - \[19:28 / 22:06 - *Q&A With My Wife*] Married life for the couple has so far been a struggle because:

  - Jordan proposed by talking about it to her rather than just popping the question, letting it come to a confident decision \[20:44 - *Q&A With My Wife*]

  - Jordan says travelling with a wife has taught him patience that he didn't know he had \[4:00 - *Q&A With My Wife*]
