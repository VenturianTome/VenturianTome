## | Series Trivia
- When asked about what happened to  Fallout 4 \(and the other Tale Series), Jordan said "YouTube happened" \(its algorithm changed and it was killing the channel because it was a series) \[37:33 - *7th Anniversary Livestream*]
  - When asked if he has thought about moving his Let's Plays to a 2nd channel, he says he could \(and eventually might) but if YouTube fixed the algorithm he'd happily go back to them \[40:05]
