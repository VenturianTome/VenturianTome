# Welcome To The Site / Introduction

Welcome to VenturianTome, a site dedicated to keeping track of everything VenturianTale!  
I am V, the main admin of the site. If you want to learn more about me or need to contact me, please do so at the links on

## Enjoy!
Feel free to peruse this dictionary of characters and pages. All of this information comes directly from the VT Sibling's videos or other social medias, followed by timestamps and sources for each bit of information.

## All The Videos!

> **NOTE:** This site is always updating when a new video comes out and while trying to catch up on older videos's info, so it is currently incomplete. Feel free to help an admin out by contacting them with more information and please be patient until it is completed. Thank you!
